This shows the initialization of static variables using static blocks... Static blocks are executed when the class
is loaded into memory and are often used to initialize static variables with logic...The static block runs only once
when the class is first loaded by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Itâ€™s not executed every time an object of the class
is created...
